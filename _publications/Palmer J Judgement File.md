<h1> In the High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry: Zhang v Guo [2021] NZHC 714 (7 April 2021) </h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
In this case, there were three main issues as described below: <br/>
<br/>
1) Did Ms Chai breach her moral duty to Mr Zhang? <br/>
2) Should Mr Zhang receive an equitable contribution? <br/>
3) Unjust Enrichment <br/>
<br/>
The Honorary Judge Palmer decided the following: <br/>
• [60] I dismiss Mr Zhang ’s applications. I order the parties to take all necessary steps for the ANZ mortgage, or any substitute for it, to be secured only over properties owned by Mr Zhang, and not over the Glenfield property. 
I reserve leave to any of the parties to apply to the Court for any further orders that are necessary to achieve that. I award costs on a 2B basis, and reasonable disbursements, to the second defendant

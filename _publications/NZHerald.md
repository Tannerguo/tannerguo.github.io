<h3>Abstract</h3>
In this case, there were three main issues as described below: <br/>
<br/>
1) Did Ms Chai breach her moral duty to Mr Zhang? <br/>
2) Should Mr Zhang receive an equitable contribution? <br/>
3) Unjust Enrichment <br/>
<br/>
The Honorary Judge Palmer decided the following: <br/>
• [60] I dismiss Mr Zhang ’s applications. I order the parties to take all necessary steps for the ANZ mortgage, or any substitute for it, to be secured only over properties owned by Mr Zhang, and not over the Glenfield property. 
I reserve leave to any of the parties to apply to the Court for any further orders that are necessary to achieve that. I award costs on a 2B basis, and reasonable disbursements, to the second defendant <br/>
<br/>
This high court case has helped another case in New Zealand's Family Court, where Christiansen v Jackson cited this case in [2024] NZFC 2717.<br/>
<br/>
Judge A M Manuel decided that: <br/>
<br/>
"(d) at 61, in good health, with no dependents, a net worth of approximately $2 million and a good income, Karen, like the de facto husband in <strong>Zhang v Guo</strong>, “is not badly off.” She has a home and a rental property. She had sufficient from the sale proceeds of Mangawhai to repay the borrowings secured over both properties and still have a “nest egg”, had she chosen to adopt that course. Since Chris died her resources have been sufficient to pay approximately $57,000 in legal fees, approximately $21,600 to repair one of her cars and approximately $107,000 to repair her Massey property.
<br/>
<br/>
[71] Karen’s application under the FPA is dismissed. All things being equal costs are to follow the event. The parties are invited to reach agreement, failing which Mitch is to file a memorandum within 14 days, after which Karen is to have 14 days to reply."

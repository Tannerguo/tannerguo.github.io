<h3>Abstract</h3>
The purpose of this project was to investigate heat generation of lithium ion batteries and how to
prevent overheating as a result of thermal runaway. <br/>
<br/>The scenario which this is investigated is through
a rider riding on a 10 degree inclined hill which puts high thermal stresses on the chosen 48V lithium
ion battery. Lithium batteries become very dangerous when they overheat because of their high energy
density. It hisses, bulges then catches fire or explode without warning, leaving the rider with acidic
electrolyte and stainless steel shrapnel. <br/>
<br/>During a thermal runaway, the heat of the failing cell inside
a battery pack may propagate to the next cell, causing them to become thermally unstable. A chain
reaction can occur in which each cell disintegrates on its own, destroying the whole battery pack very
quickly. <br/>
<br/>Iterative designs were made and selected designs were used to run simulations and compared
to each other to show the effectiveness of the design. Through various designs of the heat sink, shape
and angle of the heat fins and the use of a Pyrolytic Graphite Sheet, the most optimised heat sink
was iteratively designed through running multiple computational fluid dynamics and simulations.

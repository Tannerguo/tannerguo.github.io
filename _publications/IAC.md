<h3>Abstract</h3>
Nutrition is elementary for human existence and it poses numerous challenges for deep-space explo-
ration. The food currently used during space missions, despite its promises to deliver nutritive value to
the astronautâ€™s diet, will become unsuitable and unsustainable during longer expeditions. Nowadays, soil-
less techniques are regularly used to grow vegetables on the International Space Station, but sustainable
production of proteins still remains an unsolved issue both in space and on Earth. This paper introduces
a novel approach to this issue, proposing the production of proteins from fungi in space. Reasons and
advantages of this approach are detailed, and it is demonstrated how the proposed solution can be self-
sustainable. Furthermore, the properties of fungi can also provide solutions for water filtering and waste
management, as well as other emerging applications. A roadmap is proposed, which aims to accelerate
the development of the related technologies needed in space, while using them to solve pressing global
challenges on Earth.

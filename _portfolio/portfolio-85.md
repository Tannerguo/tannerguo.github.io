## Project Overview

The original Japanese head unit in the vehicle was limited in functionality and lacked modern features.  
The project involved **replacing it with an Apple CarPlay head unit** to enhance usability, connectivity, and media experience.

## Process

The upgrade involved:

- **Removing the existing head unit** carefully to avoid damage to surrounding panels  
- **Routing new wiring** for power, speakers, and CarPlay connectivity  
- **Mounting the new head unit** securely in the dashboard  
- **Testing all features** including audio output, CarPlay functionality, and touchscreen responsiveness  

The upgrade transformed the vehicleâ€™s infotainment system into a **modern, user-friendly interface** suitable for daily use.

The images below show the step-by-step removal, installation, and final result of the upgraded head unit.

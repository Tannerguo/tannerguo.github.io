## Project Overview

Designed and installed a 780-fiber optic starlight headliner, involving 46 hours of precision assembly, electrical integration, and aesthetic finishing. The project required careful planning, patience, and technical problem-solving to ensure a flawless result.

## Process

The project required meticulous attention to detail:

- **Hand punching holes** in the fabric while ensuring the underlying material remained intact.  
- **Threading 780 fibre optic strands** individually through the holes.  
- **Hot-gluing each fibre** and securing them to prevent deformation from heat.  

This process demanded patience and precision. While redoing a standard headliner is manageable, creating a Starlight Headliner proved far more complex.

## Project Overview

During a replacement of my sagging headliner, I decided to modify it into a **Rolls Royce-style Starlight Headliner**. This ambitious modification took **46 hours over six days** and involved intricate handcrafting techniques.

## Process

The project required meticulous attention to detail:

- **Hand punching holes** in the fabric while ensuring the underlying material remained intact.  
- **Threading 780 fibre optic strands** individually through the holes.  
- **Hot-gluing each fibre** and securing them to prevent deformation from heat.  

This process demanded patience and precision. While redoing a standard headliner is manageable, creating a Starlight Headliner proved far more complex.

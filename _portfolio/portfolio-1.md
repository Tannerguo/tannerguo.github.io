I have a couple of vehicle flap locks at home, as we have problems with random cars going up our private driveway. The product originally had two options, Option 1) Battery operated and replaceable and 2) Rechargeable Li-ion pack. I chose the first option for easy maintenance and more options to modify if necessary.

Two days ago, the flap lock would not lower to let my car in. I did some troubleshooting as to why it suddenly stopped working. Initially I thought it was a bad bluetooth connection from the plug in my cigarette lighter in the car (I unplugged and replugged) and it did not open, then I tried the remote and it did not work either so lastly I tried my Flipper Zero which I had the sub GHz frequency read and saved when I first got it but the Flipper Zero failed to trigger it (it usually can trigger it). So I replaced 2 of the 4 D cells inside the flap lock and it immediately lowered for my car.

A pack of 2x D cells cost $7.97 from The Warehouse on clearance. This will not be feasible in the long term even though these D cells have lasted nearly 2 years. Since I have 2 boxes of 20kg 18650 cells I reclaimed from dead laptop batteries a few years ago I thought about using them as they are rechargeable.

I have a couple of vehicle flap locks at home, as we have problems with random cars going up our private driveway. The product originally had two options, Option 1) Battery operated and replaceable and 2) Rechargeable Li-ion pack. I chose the first option for easy maintenance and more options to modify if necessary.

## Project Overview

In late 2023, the headliner of my car began sagging due to New Zealand’s summer heat.  
The foam backing deteriorated, causing the fabric to separate and hang loose.  
To restore the interior, I replaced it with a **foam-backed suede liner**, giving the car a refreshed and modern look.  

This replacement also set the stage for a future upgrade — the addition of **starlights**, planned for the following month.

## Process

The repair involved:

- **Removing the old headliner** and carefully detaching fragile trim pieces.  
- **Cleaning the surface** to remove deteriorated foam.  
- **Cutting and applying the suede liner** with precision to ensure a smooth, wrinkle-free finish.  
- **Reinstalling the headliner** securely for durability and a factory-quality fit.

Below is a step-by-step look at the headliner replacement process and the final result.

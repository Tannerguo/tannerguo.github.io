I have a couple of vehicle flap locks at home, as we have problems with random cars going up our private driveway. The product originally had two options, Option 1) Battery operated and replaceable and 2) Rechargeable Li-ion pack. I chose the first option for easy maintenance and more options to modify if necessary.

Two days ago, the flap lock would not lower to let my car in. I did some troubleshooting as to why it suddenly stopped working.
* Unplugged and plugged in the bluetooth dongle in the cigarette lighter in my car
* Clicked unlock on the remote multiple times with pauses in between
* Used the recorded sub-GHz frequency on my Flipper Zero
None of the methods above worked so I realised the battery must be dead. I replaced 2 of the 4 D cells and it worked.

A pack of 2x D cells cost $7.97 from The Warehouse on clearance. This will not be feasible in the long term even though these D cells have lasted nearly 2 years. Since I have 2 boxes of 20kg 18650 cells I reclaimed from dead laptop batteries a few years ago I thought about using them as they are rechargeable.

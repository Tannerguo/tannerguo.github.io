## Project Overview

I built a **raised planter box** to help my grandmother grow vegetables and flowers more comfortably, providing easier access and better soil drainage.

## Process

Steps involved:

- **Measuring and cutting timber** to the required dimensions  
- **Assembling the box** using screws and wood glue for stability  
- **Sanding and finishing** the timber to ensure longevity and smooth edges  
- **Placing the planter** and filling it with soil for planting

The images below show the step-by-step construction process and the completed planter box.

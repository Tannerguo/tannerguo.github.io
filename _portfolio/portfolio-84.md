## Project Overview

I ran Ethernet cables around the **exterior of a residential property** to connect security cameras.  
The goal was to create a reliable wired connection that could support **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** and provide consistent video feeds.

## Process

The installation required several steps:

- **Planning cable routes** along the exterior of the house for both protection and accessibility  
- **Drilling and securing conduit/clips** to neatly run Ethernet cables  
- **Pulling cables through exterior walls** and ensuring proper weatherproofing  
- **Terminating cables to T568B standard**, ensuring correct pinouts and strong connections  
- **Testing connectivity** to verify bandwidth and PoE delivery to all cameras  

This setup ensures that the security system operates with **stable power and high-speed data**, avoiding the limitations of Wi-Fi.

The following images show the installation process and final cable terminations.

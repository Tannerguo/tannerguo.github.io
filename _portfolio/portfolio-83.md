## Project Overview

I designed, built, and installed a **custom timber fence gate** for a residential property.  
The goal was to create a functional and durable solution while maintaining a clean and professional appearance.

## Process

The project involved several key steps:

- **Designing the gate dimensions** to fit the existing fence line  
- **Measuring and cutting timber** to the correct lengths  
- **Assembling the gate frame** and ensuring rigidity  
- **Digging post holes** and setting the posts securely in place  
- **Levelling and aligning** the gate to ensure smooth operation  

The finished gate provides both security and easy access, blending seamlessly with the surrounding fence.

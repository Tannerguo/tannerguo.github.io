## Project Overview

After the Auckland floods, I decided to install a **French Drain** around the house. While the property did not experience flooding directly, it was a proactive measure to prevent future water damage and improve drainage.

## Process

The installation involved:

- **Assessing the terrain** and identifying the areas most prone to water accumulation  
- **Excavating trenches** along the perimeter where water could collect  
- **Laying perforated drainage pipes** to channel water away from the foundation  
- **Adding gravel and protective mesh** to prevent clogging and improve flow  
- **Backfilling and finishing** to restore the landscape  

This solution ensures reliable water management and protects the property from potential flooding.

## Project Overview

This project involved **laying vinyl flooring** to protect the existing rimu floors from wear and tear due to foot and pet traffic. The vinyl layer provides a durable, low-maintenance surface while preserving the original flooring underneath.

## Process

The steps included:

- **Preparing the subfloor** to ensure it was clean and level  
- **Measuring and cutting vinyl sheets** to fit the room layout  
- **Laying and securing the vinyl** carefully to avoid bubbles or gaps  
- **Finishing touches**, ensuring edges and corners were neatly aligned  

This approach extended the lifespan of the rimu flooring while maintaining aesthetics.

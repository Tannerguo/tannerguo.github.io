## Project Overview

This renovation involved **upgrading an old kitchen** to a modern functional space. I personally handled the demolition and most of the installation work, including cabinetry, fixtures, and general construction.

All plumbing that needed to go inside the walls was completed by a **qualified plumbing contractor** to meet safety and code requirements.

## Process

Key steps included:

- **Demolition** of old cabinetry, countertops, and fixtures  
- **Installation of new cabinetry and countertops** to modern standards  
- **Plumbing coordination** with a certified plumber for in-wall connections  
- **Finishing touches**, including hardware, backsplash, and final clean-up  

This project improved both the functionality and aesthetics of the kitchen.

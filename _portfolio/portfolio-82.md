## Project Overview

Performed battery and screen replacements on iPhones, applying precision assembly techniques and ensuring full post repair functionality.

## Process

The repair process involved:

- **Disassembling the iPhone 6** carefully to access internal components  
- **Replacing the cracked display** with a new screen assembly  
- **Swapping out the degraded battery** for a new one to restore normal runtime  
- **Reassembling and testing** to ensure full touchscreen functionality and stable battery performance  

The repair not only restored the phone to working condition but also provided a reliable backup device.

## Gallery

The following images document the cracked screen, the replacement process, and the final fully functional iPhone 6.

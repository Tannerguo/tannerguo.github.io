## Project Overview

I was given an **iPhone 6 for free** that had two major issues:  
- A **cracked front screen**  
- A **failing battery** that drained extremely quickly  

Rather than discarding it, I decided to repair the device, extending its useful life and preventing unnecessary electronic waste.

## Process

The repair process involved:

- **Disassembling the iPhone 6** carefully to access internal components  
- **Replacing the cracked display** with a new screen assembly  
- **Swapping out the degraded battery** for a new one to restore normal runtime  
- **Reassembling and testing** to ensure full touchscreen functionality and stable battery performance  

The repair not only restored the phone to working condition but also provided a reliable backup device.

## Gallery

The following images document the cracked screen, the replacement process, and the final fully functional iPhone 6.

Solar garden light won't last more than 2 hours during winter when it only gets 3-4 hours of sunlight. So I decided to increase the battery capacity which now runs for 12+ hours. <br/>
The 'new' batteries are made from harvested 18650 cells from 'dead' laptop batteries. Laptop batteries are wired in series so when one cell fails, the other 5-7 cells remain in good condition - these are harvested to make a new battery to power other things such as these solar garden lights

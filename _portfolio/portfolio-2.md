## Project Overview

Standard solar garden lights typically run for **less than 2 hours during winter**, as they only receive around 3–4 hours of sunlight per day.  
To solve this, I increased their **battery capacity**, allowing them to run for **12+ hours continuously**.

The solution involved repurposing batteries from old laptops, which often contain multiple working cells even if the pack itself is considered “dead.”

## Process

- **Harvesting 18650 cells** from discarded laptop batteries.  
  - Laptop batteries are typically wired in series, so one failed cell renders the whole pack unusable, while other cells remain in good condition.  
- **Testing and selecting healthy cells** to ensure safety and performance.  
- **Spot-welding 18650 cells** together, creating a higher capacity battery pack.
- **Building new packs** from the harvested cells.  
- **Integrating via soldering the pack into the BMS** to significantly boost the runtime.  

This project demonstrates how e-waste can be reused sustainably while enhancing capacity and performance.

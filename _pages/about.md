Biography
======
What I'm doing in my spare time: <br>
- Python and Raspberry Pi coding. Fixing, repairing and improving hardware around the house
- Currently reading: "Surviving The Great Depression of 1990: Protect Your Assets and Investments - and Come Out on Top"

Interests
------
Some other interests I have are:
- Repurposing old battery packs such as disassembling old laptop battery packs or power tool battery packs, capacity testing each cell and then repackaging and spot welding a new battery pack out of mixed cells.
- Repaired, fixed and made modifications on iPhones, Macbooks and iPods. <br\> <br\>
In terms of hands on skills, I have:
- Diagnosed (By writing down the binary code produced by the washing machine, searching the corresponding binary code with error code, matched the error code on Google - a broken out of balance sensor and fixed the Fisher & Paykel washing machine with a new sensor
- Fixed a leaking Fisher & Paykel 2 door fridge freezer
- Fixed the seat tilt mechanism on a Herman Miller Sayl
- Measured, designed and printed a part in PLA+ of the window spray nozzle for the front windscreen of my car (the only thing it failed in its WOF) in which it passed its WOF but then melted shortly after...reprinted in PETG
- Diagnosed the correct brushless motor and the problem on a Boosted Board V2 (electric skateboard) - fixed with dielectric grease

<a href=/publication/FYP/>External Forces on Financial Markets: Evidence from the GameStop Short Squeeze and Flash Crash</a>
</div>
<a href=/publication/FYP/ class=summary-link>
<div class=article-style>
<p>In this research, we present a system of equations for measuring external forces in financial markets. As in physics, we claim that there is a measurable force caused by external market forces, which we call investor impatience and equate with gravitational force. We simulate this force and its accompanying energy conservation equation equation using a physics- based Eulerian fluid flow system. We test this idea by analyzing minute-by-minute data from meme stocks during a one-of-a-kind market event, the January 2021 the GameStop short squeeze. The resultant parameters show that external forces have an effect on stock prices. The investor impatience parameter is shown to improve out-of-sample forecasting of investor sentiment, estimated using comments from Redditâ€™s WallStreetBets forum during the short squeeze. We expand our study to the 2010 flash crash, demonstrating that the system accounts for exogenous influences on market behavior.</p>

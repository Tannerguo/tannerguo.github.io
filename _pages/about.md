Biography
======
My research interests are in battery technology and nuclear energy. In my spare time I like to tinker with AI recognition implementation for home surveillance systems through Linux. I am currently researching a way to bypass region lock on Roborock robotic vacuums from China


Interests
------
Some other interests I have are repurposing old battery packs such as disassembling old laptop battery packs or power tool battery packs, capacity testing each cell and then repackaging and spot welding a new battery pack out of mixed cells. I have also repaired, fixed and made modifications on iPhones, Macbooks and iPods. In terms of hands on skills, I have diagnosed and fixed Fisher & Paykel washing machine with a faulty out of balance sensor, a leaking Fisher & Paykel 2 door refrigerator, fixed the seat tilt mechanism on a Herman Miller chair, measure designed and printed a part of the window spray nozzle for the front windscreen of my car(the only thing it failed in its WOF) in which it passed its WOF, diagnosed and fixed a brushless motor with silicon grease,

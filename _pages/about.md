Biography
======
My research interests are in battery technology and nuclear energy. In my spare time I like to tinker with AI recognition implementation for home surveillance systems through Linux. <br> <br>
What I'm doing now: researching a way to bypass region lock on Roborock robotic vacuums from China


Interests
------
Some other interests I have are:
- Repurposing old battery packs such as disassembling old laptop battery packs or power tool battery packs, capacity testing each cell and then repackaging and spot welding a new battery pack out of mixed cells.
- Repairing, fixed and made modifications on iPhones, Macbooks and iPods.
In terms of hands on skills, I have:
- Diagnosed and fixed a Fisher & Paykel washing machine with a faulty out of balance sensor
- A leaking Fisher & Paykel 2 door fridge freezer
- Fixed the seat tilt mechanism on a Herman Miller chair
- Measure designed and printed a part of the window spray nozzle for the front windscreen of my car(the only thing it failed in its WOF) in which it passed its WOF
- Diagnosed the correct brushless motor and the problem on a Boosted Board V2 (electric skateboard) and fixed it with dielectric grease  

Education
